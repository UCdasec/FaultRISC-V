Digitally secured lock based on password verification is explained. The system uses a LCD display array to show the password, a matrix keypad to enter the numbers/password and operates a relay (to activate the solenoid valve) for locking and unlocking purpose. The system alarms through a buzzer if a wrong password is entered for 3 times continuously and an SMS is sent to a predefined contact number. The password can be changed whenever required, but only after correctly entering the present password. The password is stored in the EEPROM of the microcontroller so that, power failure or reset of the system does not affect the password recognition.
